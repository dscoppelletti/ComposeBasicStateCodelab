# State in Jetpack Compose Codelab

This folder contains the source code for the
[State in Jetpack Compose codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/jetpack-compose-state).

In this codelab, you will explore patterns for working with state in a
declarative world by building a Wellness application. Youâ€™ll learn how to think
about state and events in Compose, the mechanism Compose uses to track state
changes and update the UI accordingly with APIs such as mutableStateOf and how
you can use your ViewModels in a Compose app.
